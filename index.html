    <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Loan is the lending of money by individual in which the borrower incurs a debt that is paid as interest.</li>
            <li>It becomes a challenging task for banks to find if a person may or may not repay the loan.</li>
            <li>Traditionally bankers take basic information such as annual income ,previous loan history and assets to find out the eligibility of a person.</li>
            <li>With the advancement of digital banking we now have large datasets containing information about previous loan transactions.</li>
            <li><p>With the help of machine learning we can build models that can identify the eligibility and amount of loan to be given.</p></li>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We will make two models, one that classifies if a person is eligible for a loan or not and second is how much loan can be given as a safe investment.</li>
            <li>With the help of Linear regression and Logisitc Regression we can make both the models.</li>
            <li>We will try to apply Neural Networks on our model to make it much better.</li>
        </ul>
