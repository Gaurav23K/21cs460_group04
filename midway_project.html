    <h2>Midway</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>The primary data for the loan prediction model is obtained from “National Sample Survey (NSS) 77th round”, and the datasets are collected by the government of India.
                The raw data collected from NSS is not as tidy as the data-frame shown during the project proposal.
                </p></li>
            <li>Under NSS, this data is collected under All India Debt & Investment Survery-2019</li>
            <li>NSS surveyed over 118000 households and over 3 lakh individuals.Survey contains 14 blocks having data for basic information and debt information.</li>
            <li><p>In India loans are usually returned as of by the whole household people than individually, so here we have related the people individually who have the access to credit cards and e-wallets. Because credit cards and e-wallets are the parameters which affects directly the chances of getting a loan from the bank.</p></li>
            <li><p>The savings details of the individual person is not available, only the details of whether the person has issued a credit card or an e-wallet.</p></li>
            
        </ul>
       
    <h2>Plan</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Here we have two approaches, First we have to work on individual data and secondly we can work on household data </li>
            <li>In case of individual data, we have variables such as gender,eduation, age,land ,credit card and e-wallet data .Here we take gender,education, age as independent variable and owning credit card or e-wallet as dependent variable </li>
            <li>For household data we have information regard debt such as applied for loan ,amount of loan.With the help of the same independent variables we can work out independent variable loan payment .</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Algorithms and Datasets</h2>

            <li>value of transactions by household</li>
          
        </ul>
    
    
    <h3>E-wallet prediction</h3>
    <p>Here we use 2 algorithms decision tree and naive bayes classifier with dependent variable as owning e-wallet.This model can be a good indicator for predicting socio-economic status of our country.
        <ul>
            <li>The accuracy of decision tree is:  0.8108472028683712</li>
            <li>The accuracy of Naive baise is:  0.8019226854968764</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Credit-card prediction</h3>
    <p>Here we use 2 algorithms decision tree and naive bayes classifier with dependent variable as owning credit card.This model can be a good indicator for predicting socio-economic status of our country.
        <ul>
            <li>The accuracy of decision tree is:  0.9750426654558549</li>
            <li>The accuracy of Naive baise is:  0.9348353661400679</li>
